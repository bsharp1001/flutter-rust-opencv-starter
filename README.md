# flutter_rust_opencv_prototype

## IMPORTANT: OpenCV is currently compiled for a real android arm64 -aarch64- device only

## WON'T WORK WITH EMULATORS

1. connect any android device with arm64 -aarch64- cpu
2. ensure debugging is enabled
3. Run `flutter run` and be sure it uses the connected android device
4. The app should start successfully showing a UI similar to the contest entry's screenshot
